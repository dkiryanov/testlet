# Testlet
In the assessments industry, items are test questions to be answered by candidates. Items can be pretest or 
operational. Pretest items don’t count towards a candidate’s score. 
Candidates are given a set of items they need to answer. This set is called a Testlet.

Using Test-First Development build the functionality below -
* There is a Testlet with a fixed set of 10 items. 6 of the items are operational and 4 of them are pretest items.
* The requirement is that the _order_ of these items should be randomized such that -
* The first 2 items are always pretest items selected randomly from the 4 pretest items.
* The next 8 items are mix of pretest and operational items ordered randomly from the remaining 8 
items.
